Recently I had a need to extract the number from a string in the database.  The string would be something like ‘Monitor 16?‘ or “16 inch Monitor”.   
I would need to get the size for various reasons including fees and reports, but no real good way of doing it.  I have come up with the following 
Scalar SQL Function to do this very job.
